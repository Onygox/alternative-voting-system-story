        <br>Have you ever felt like the very governmental structure of the country you live in is fundamentally flawed? Well, have I got the project for you!<br><br>

        During the last semester I found that many of my classmates and playtesters did not know how America’s electoral system worked.<br><br>
        
        I’m creating an interactive narrative that’s meant to educate the masses on the inner workings of America’s electoral college, describe its shortcomings
        and explain how they’re bad for the citizens of the US. I’d also like to lay out some alternative systems and how those ones are better for us.<br><br>
        
        This experience will educate by means of an online chatroom with characters representing real-world people and voting systems, designing interactive
        voting mechanics for specific story events, and prompting self-induced research.<br>
