    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
        My finalized thesis project will take the form of a digital application for the web, and, if possible, Android and iOS.
         I will build it in Unity with the help of various assets and plugins I’ve found on the Unity Asset Store; mainly Ink, 
         a scripting language for visual and text-based interactive narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application itself will consist of a story-based interactive narrative that takes place in an online chatroom similar 
        to Discord or Slack, with characters who represent various real-world people and concepts. The intent of this narrative 
        will be to educate its audience on the pitfalls of the American Electoral College, and how they can help to overthrow it 
        in favor of a better system.
    </P>

        On a more molecular level, here’s an in-depth description of what will live in the Unity inspector and project hierarchy:<br><br>

        <pre>
        • A GameManager that converts my Ink story into unity-readable text<br>
        • A canvas that displays said text in the format that i want it<br>
        • A title screen that the user can start the experience with and return to once done<br>
        • A canvas that shows the user’s stats between scenes<br>
        • Canvases that show each character’s bio and profile information<br>
        • Sound effects, and, if suitable, music.
        • Some way to open links in order to teach the user about real-world concepts using the web
        </pre>
        And the physical embodiment of the project, when it exists on the exhibition floor, will have:<br><br>

        <pre>
        • A device capable of running the application (perhaps two - whatever I can find or afford)<br>
        • A polling booth or curtain in which the audience enters to experience it
        </pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This means that my complete workload, plus the time it will take to complete each task, looks something along the lines of:
