    <h1>Change The Vote</h1>
    <p>
        This is an interactive narrative piece meant to compel new voters into learning more about the system they are beginning to interact with,
        describe its shortcomings, and offer alternatives for future thought exercises.<br><br>
        Click on the <b>words themselves</b>, not the box surrounding them, to choose a choice. Whenever you get to a point with white
        run-on sentence text or a bit that says "End of Demo", you've reached the end of the playable section.<br><br>
        Also, it should automatically scroll to the bottom of the  page after text appears (as long as you're on the current bottom of the page),
        but if it doesn't, you're gonna have to scroll for yourself.<br><br>
        Thanks for bearing with me, and thanks for checking out this project!
