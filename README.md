# Change The Vote *(working title)*

A project I am working on as my BFA Thesis.

It is meant to educate the masses about voting systems that can potentially replace the Electoral College. *(Because the Electoral College doesn't fulfill the needs of U.S. citizens to the same degree that other country's voting systems fulfill the needs of their respective citizens, which I plan to address in this project!)*

Demo is available at https://onygox.github.io/alternative-voting-system-story/ and is constantly being updated.

# Preliminary Notes

Text with various voting systems personalities as if you were hanging out the previous day (so it doesn't have to be in present tense)

Story ends with a meeting at a polling booth

Throughout the story each system is trying to establish a date with you at the polling booth at the exact same time as each other, so you must choose one and cancel the rest

Ooh I also like the idea of different “voting system personalities” talking behind each other’s backs, badmouthing each other, or complimenting each other!

Implement voting systems into the game so that the user gets hands-on experience, integrate them into the story somehow! Like the “personality” asks the user to rate various things from their adventures the previous day

Each day is not “real time” - they just occur as soon as you complete  the previous day in game
